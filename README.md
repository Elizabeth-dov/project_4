# Project 4 - Credit Card Debt Payoff Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Credit Card Debt Payoff App project.

## Overview

This project is a website for a credit card debt payoff app designed to help users manage and eliminate their credit card debt efficiently. It offers features such as debt consolidation, automated payments, and personalized financial plans. The website was designed and built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which allowed for a responsive and aesthetic appearance and dynamic functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- **SCSS**: Styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and dynamic content.
- **Gulp**: It helped me effectively manage and automate routine activities such as compiling CSS from preprocessors, minifying and combining JavaScript files, optimizing images and live browser synchronization (live reloading).

## Functions
- **Responsive design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Interactive elements**: Using JavaScript to add dynamic features.
- **Aesthetic appearance**: Careful use of CSS to create an attractive appearance.
